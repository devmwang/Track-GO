# CPSC 210 Term Project (Track:GO)

## CS:GO Player/Roster Statistics Tracker and Visualizer

### What will this project (Track:GO) do?

Track:GO will allow users to enter CS:GO match data in order to analyze and track specifics
with greater ease. The user will be able to enter data from matches they play. Then, they
can view data from each prior match, view overall data (like overall win rate or average 
damage per round), or perform trend analysis with the program to see how their performance
may be improving or declining.

### Who will use it?

- General/regular players of CS:GO to track their personal and friend stats.
- CS:GO team coaches/data analysts (to help them analyze historical data more effectively).

### Why this project is of interest to me

I play CS:GO quite often (with a group of friends). Often, we want to be able to look at 
and analyze historical data, or view personalized stats. Additionally, we find it
interesting to view data on group data, like map win rate as a group, or overall win rate
depending on who is playing.
