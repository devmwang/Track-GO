# Track:GO

## CS:GO Player/Roster Statistics Tracker and Visualizer

Track:GO allows users to enter CS:GO match data in order to analyze and track specifics with greater ease. Users can enter data from matches they play. From there, they can view data from each prior match, view overall data (like overall win rate or average damage per round), or check to see if their performance is improving or declining.
